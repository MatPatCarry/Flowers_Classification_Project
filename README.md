# Flowers Classification Project
### In this repository can be found half-term project for my BigData Methods and Tools univesity classes. It is an image classification problem in which we are given different photos of flowers and are supposed to write a programme which will be able to classify them by specified species. To deal with this problem I implemented Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and TensorFlow librares. To make this task even more demanding, apart from taking flowers photos from [Flowers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/flowers), I decided to search for more data using images gathering programs. Then I had to check wheter they are valid or not, usually one by one. I came across with plenty of problems - from low quality to photos where flower was barely visible. However, the biggest problem was to get rid of photos which contained species which were other than the one I was looking for, but appriopriate and reliable data is the key to success. Every single step is described in [.ipynb file](https://github.com/MatPatCarry/Flowers_Classification_Project/blob/main/flowers_classification.ipynb), so I encourage you to check it out!
