# Flowers Classification Project (unfinished)
### In this repository can be found half-term project for my BigData Methods and Tools university classes. It is an image classification problem in which we are given different photos of flowers and are supposed to write a programme which will be able to classify them by specified species. To deal with this problem I implemented the Convolutional Neural Network using Keras and TensorFlow librares. To make this task even more demanding, apart from taking flowers photos from [Flowers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/l3llff/flowers), I decided to search for more data using images gathering programs. Then I had to check wheter they are valid or not, usually one by one. I came across with plenty of problems - from low quality to photos where flower was barely visible. However, the biggest problem was to get rid of photos which contained species which were other than the one I was looking for, but appriopriate and reliable data is the key to success. Every single step for manually built CNN is described in [flowers_classification_manual.ipynb file](https://github.com/MatPatCarry/Flowers_Classification_Project/blob/main/flowers_classification_Manual.ipynb). I have also wanted to play with the [MobileNetV2 CNN](https://keras.io/api/applications/mobilenet/#mobilenetv2-function) and results of this can be found [here](https://github.com/MatPatCarry/Flowers_Classification_Project/blob/main/flowers_classification_MobileNetV2.ipynb). Functions which I wrote and used are stored in [functions.py](https://github.com/MatPatCarry/Flowers_Classification_Project/blob/main/functions_to_use.py) - it is much easier to import them from .py file. To conclude, I encourage you to check these files out! If you have some questions, it would be a pleasure for me to try to answer them ;)
